## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

**Codex Arcanum** is a mod that aims to expand Balatro by adding a new type of consumable card: **Alchemical Cards**!

Alchemical cards possess powerful abilities that you can use in a blind, like adding hands and discards, drawing cards, reducing the blind, and much more!
